\section*{Problem 2}
For this problem, we must handle the failure cause by the fact that a biker may fall down during the race.
To solve this problem, we need to modify our solution of problem 1. Our design requires the use of a 
failure detector. To build it, we use a simple heartbeat algorithm.

A heartbeat is a mechanism can detect a crash node within a bounded time. The algorithm exchanges 
messages all processes and uses a specific timeout mechanism initialized with a delay. During this period,
all processes have the time to send messages (request messages and reply messages). After they are considered as crashed. But we must be careful that
all processes have enough time to send the messages.
